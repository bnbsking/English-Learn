# The Unexpected Challenges of a New Career

Starting a new career is often a **hazardous** journey, full of **countless** uncertainties and moments that **irritate** and test one's resolve. I remember my first few months as a junior project manager. I was **eager to** prove myself, but I quickly learned that things aren't always as straightforward as they seem.

My initial **diagnosis** of the situation was overly optimistic. I **typically** believed that with enough hard work, I could **complete successfully** any task assigned to me. However, I soon realized that I needed to be more **far-sighted**, anticipating potential problems.

One of the biggest challenges was learning to **be accountable/responsible for** my mistakes. There were times I'd **bump/run into** unexpected difficulties. My attempts to **facilitate** team meetings often **culminate in** frustrated colleagues. Iâ€™d find myself wanting to **lament over** my failures, but I knew I had to learn from them. I had to **erase** any ego that might lead to the **crease** of my self-confidence.

Negotiating a **salary** was a hurdle. My initial expectations were perhaps a **minus** figure compared to what I eventually ended up being offered. This was, in a way, **satisfy**ing, but not entirely. And when things went south, no one was there to **console** me. I had to **buckle up** for the **siege**.

I also found the office politics somewhat challenging. I **invariably** saw others **incite** each other with competitive behavior, and I had to learn to navigate these dynamics. While I wanted to be **cordial** with everyone, I also had to stand my ground. One must **understand** that the **moral** of a working environment can influence your performance. I tried to **appease** those whose approach may not be aligned with my understanding of teamwork, but it was not always easy.

I needed to learn quickly and adapt. I even took a few **amateur** coding classes on the weekends to broaden my skillset. I found a friend who was an **eloquent** speaker and I hoped he would be able to advise me and give me the proper **assurance** that I will be doing better. I wanted to be a **giver** and help others, but I had to find the right balance.

One particular challenge was a manufacturing defect that required me to deal with the **Warranty** team. Dealing with the clients' problems was not the best situation, as some of them could not be **appeased**, however, my goal was to find a way to **satisfy** them. It felt like navigating a minefield of expectations. I also had to remember that despite the **expropriate** nature of my job, I should **be content with** my role. There was also an **exuberant** discussion about the design and material for my work.

Later on, I had to **postpone** the project and was very unhappy. To feel better I went to a small **chapel** and sang an **anthem**. The next day I got a **profit bonus**. I was very **keen** to get the ball rolling again. I saw some **gravel** on the floor and I thought I was going to **bark** like a dog. I was able to see the **rebound**.

The **Demography** of the workplace, too, was diverse. The senior **bishop** was trying to **eject** from the building due to the lack of space. In a corporate environment, you have a **convention** about how you should act.

Dealing with mistakes and setbacks can **have serious repercussions for** your career, but learning from them is vital. Now, several years later, I am much more **keen** and confident.
