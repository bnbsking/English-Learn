Here's an article incorporating all of the provided vocabulary words:

The **city center** buzzed with a familiar energy, a constant hum of activity that threatened to **Pre|ci|pi|tate** a sense of chaos. I, a rather **timid** soul, felt the pressure **in earnest** to navigate the throngs of people. The **ante|cedent** to this urban adventure, however, was far more unsettling: I had just received a diagnosis, a suspected **malignant tumor**. This knowledge, though **unbelievable**, forced me to consider my mortality.

My **economic circumstance** had always been **inadequacy** defined. I was a **carpenter** by trade, a profession that rarely brought **ample** financial rewards. Iâ€™d **acquire** tools and **merchandise** slowly, piecemeal, always hoping my work would **bring/has benefits/profits to** my family. The thought of leaving them caused me to **brood over** the future, fearing the **cumbersome** process of dealing with my affairs. My neighbors, a diverse mix of **ethnics**, offered words of comfort, but their **talkative** nature sometimes bordered on **mouthy**, leading to occasional **quarrel**.

A recent **convention** had brought a surge of visitors, many sporting **ostentatious** displays of wealth. The sight of such extravagance made me **dwellt** on my own limitations. I felt a deep **abrasion** against my hopes and dreams.

The memory of a **pipe dream** of sailing, the **captain** of my own ship, seemed especially poignant. Then, a real threat was **typhoon** that could destroy me. 

Instead of sailing, I'm here in the **city center**. The **ceramics** in the shop windows were beautiful, but their price tag made them **elude** me. My **myopia** regarding my finances had always **restrain** me, but now I had to act. I'd always try to **exterminate** all the negative thoughts. The **sediment** of worry settled in my stomach, a constant reminder of the uncertainty ahead.

The **late** afternoon sun cast long shadows, and a **boring** predictability set in. I decided to finally confront my **tax evasion** issue, something I'd put off for far too long. The consequences would be difficult to **elude**.

Despite my fear, I found an **absorbing** quality in the everyday: the **bark** of a dog, the promise of a new **appliance**, the rhythmic whir of a **conveyor** belt in the distance. My friend, a **courageous** soul, reminded me that life was to be lived, even with the **determinate** challenges ahead. He said to not see the **feature** of my life as the last.

The **cannon** shot from the nearby park marked 6 o'clock. I bought some small **fragment** of food for the evening and went home. The **successive** days were filled with hospital appointments and procedures, each one **consecutive** in its impact. I would always remember my parents telling me a story in a **figurative** way.

I decided to **nominate** myself to live a more **courageous** life.
