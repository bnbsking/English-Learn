## The Senator's Dilemma: A Political Fable

Senator Thorne, a **pompous** man known for his **contempt** towards the less fortunate, found himself in a **dreadful** situation. The **wealth inequality** in his district was staggering, a constant **ailment** he, unfortunately, had to confront. He'd always been a **ruthless** pragmatist, and his supporters knew this, leading them to **exhort** him to remain steadfast. He was the **attendant** to their needs, or so they thought.

Thorne’s political machine, fueled by generous **donors**, relied on **property** ownership and the promise of upward mobility. But now, whispers of corruption and shady dealings had begun to surface, threatening to **go off the rail**. An **audit** loomed, and the **invisible** cracks in his carefully constructed facade were starting to show. A **caveat** about his past dealings, previously well **suppressed**, now threatened to topple his entire career.

He faced the **compulsory** need to **represent** his district, a task made more challenging by the public's **cynical** outlook. His **determination** to stay in the **limelight** was tested daily. He had to somehow **bypass** the growing criticism and regain control.

He knew a key **contributor** to his campaign was involved in a scheme that had allowed a **destructive insect** to ravage local farms. He considered how he might **eliminate** his involvement, though this thought felt rather **clumsy**.

He remembered the **bond** he had to the city and the people living there. Thorne felt his political life, much like an **avalanche**, was speeding out of his control. He tried to **tame** his anxiety, to **carry through** and maintain control. He decided to **fasten seat belt** and prepare for the worst.

He decided to visit his long time friend, a local doctor, who was treating a mysterious **hereditary ailment**. The doctor needed Thorne to **deposit** a large sum of money to help fund the investigation into the cause. This action seemed to **deviate** from his usual dealings.

His friend was a **novice** to the political game, so Thorne tried to **appeasement** the doctor by suggesting that his support was **desirable**. However, the doctor was unwilling to offer any **allegiance** until all his patients had been **accommodated in** an **affordable** hospital. The doctor had to be **accommodated in** an **affordable** hospital, but there was no more room.

The senator’s assistant, a **novice** politician, informed him that they had to **barricade** their office due to a protest. He felt the urge to **be terrorized** by what lay ahead. They also needed a strong **detergent** to clean the office and a **flashlight** in case the power went out.

The senator walked to the nearest **franchise store** in his car, he was hoping to **thrive**. But first, he wanted to use the **bunk** of cash in his pocket to buy some **cushion**. He knew that this was **obligatory** in his current circumstances.

He had to **vie with** his political enemies to stay in power. He realised that they couldn't always trust that his actions would not be seen as **contempt**. He tried to convince himself that he was doing it all for the greater good, but deep down, he knew he was becoming a monster.

He was, after all, just a man, and his career could very easily **eliminate** itself.
