## The Eccentric Patron and the Whispers of Fraud

The **portrait** of Lord Ashworth, the town's most **eccentric** **patron**, hung in the town hall, a constant reminder of his generosity and, lately, the whispers of something more sinister. Ashworth, a man known for his **shrewd** investments and equally peculiar hobbies, had recently become the subject of rumor. The townsfolk, once grateful for his **sponsorship** of local projects, were now **wary about** his affairs.

It all started with the rumored discovery of a **fraud** within his investments. Although the official **audit** found no fault, there were subtle hints, things that were meant to **imply that** all wasn't as it seemed. **On the contrary**, those close to Ashworth insisted that it was all just gossip, that the accusations were aimed at the wrong man. But the doubts began to **erode** their trust.

Young Emily, his former **pupil** in the arts, **detested** the new rumors and took it as her **chore** to protect her **sponsor**. Her family was offered an **annuity** by the patron. She was not sure what to do with the **incentive bonus** and began to **blush** anytime the subject came up.

One day, while attempting to **condense** the information about Ashworth into a concise report, she **come across** a particularly **significant** piece of information. It was a mention of a distant land, hinting at a possible **exile** of someone linked to Ashworth’s finances. It seemed as though some people wanted to **do away with** the ones who knew the truth.

The **priest**, a **decent** man, tried to offer **caution** and **confer** some advice to Emily. He did not **disagree with** her investigation, however, he encouraged her to not **throw** away the good memories of her mentor. He was **wary about** the information, because if she **apprehend** someone the case could **lead to** a bigger **tragedy**.

The rumors reached a fever pitch when a **bushfire** ravaged the outskirts of town, leading to the **contamination** of the local water supply. Many saw it as a **symbolic** act, reflecting the corruption they believed was festering beneath the surface. Emily felt compelled to **advocate** for the truth, even though it put her in a difficult position. It was as though Ashworth’s actions were a **mania** which could only be stopped by revealing the truth.

Emily and the priest eventually decided to **immerse** themselves in the investigation, determined to uncover the truth, even if it meant **showing hostility to** the man who had once been their benefactor. However, the details were obscure, like reading **artillery** manuals. To make matters worse, the old adage that "there **ain't** no such thing as a free lunch" kept haunting them. The whole thing was complex.

Finally, they discovered the evidence was so devastating that Ashworth did not know how to respond. He chose to flee, but before he could get far, he was apprehended. The ensuing scandal, a true **tragedy**, revealed a complex web of deceit, leaving the town to face the aftermath. Even the *herbivorous* animals were affected by the event. The investigation was never going to be an **elective subject**. There was a local **confederation** that wanted to make sure everything was in the clear. The **janitor** had a job to do.

The events had profound effects. Some families wanted to **inhume** their ancestors. The **recycling** plant was destroyed. The **clip** of his favorite movie was lost. The incident was just too much. After this event, the town decided to **dodgeball** any future corruption. All the townsfolk could do was to **worship** the spirit of the honest people. The experience **endow** them with a new sense of duty.
