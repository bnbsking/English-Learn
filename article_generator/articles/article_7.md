The authorities quickly began to **detain** anyone they considered suspicious. The robbers, it seemed, had **breach** the security protocols with expertise, leaving behind a trail of confusion. They used sophisticated techniques, which suggested they were **canny**, knowing exactly how to execute their plan. The lack of guards was **weird**, as there was only an **attendant** present, and it was not **audible** whether any alarm was ever activated.

The authorities suspected the ringleader was a former **butcher**, known for his ruthless business practices, who had previously tried to **defraud** several people. The **prospectus** described the stolen items as extremely valuable, perhaps the **ultimate** haul.

The potential loss was significant. The owners of the stolen art may have to **forfeit** their claims. The **donor** who provided the funds might have lost their investment.

The chief of police was **eligible to** a reward for bringing the perpetrators to justice. He promised to **purge** the city of criminals. The police was using **ornament** to identify any criminal actions, hoping that would help them capture the **bolt** of criminals.
