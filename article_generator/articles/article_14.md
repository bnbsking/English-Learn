Here's an article incorporating all of the provided vocabulary words:

The **bulletin board** in the town square was usually full of **commonplace** announcements: lost pets, community events, and the occasional plea for help. Today, however, it held a notice that sparked both curiosity and **dismay**. The notice described an impending **uprising**, fueled by the **erratic** behavior of the local **barbarian** warlord, Grugg.

Many townsfolk, remembering Grugg's previous outbursts, were **wary about** the situation. They recalled stories of him attempting to **dump sb** (though nobody knew who he had designs on!) and how he'd **show his contempt** for anything remotely organized. The elders, especially, felt the situation was serious. Their **pension** funds were largely dependent on trade with the neighboring kingdom, and they had to avoid anything that would **disrupt** that commerce.

Old Man Hemlock, a known **aficionado** of historical battles, had always been considered **far-sighted**. He believed the warlord was **intimidate** the town into providing an extra **fare** (or perhaps, he felt, he planned to **delay sth**â€”the inevitable conflict). He'd **dig** up old maps and **directory** listings for old conflicts in hopes of finding a **clue** to Grugg's strategy. The **outlook/prospect is** grim, Hemlock **implied that**. He feared the warlord's army, augmented by mercenaries from a fringe **denomination**, would eventually **engulf** the town in a wave of violence. This made him **detest** the situation even more.

The town's **pastor**, a gentle soul, tried to **condole with** the worried families, **assure sb that** he would do everything to avoid a conflict, and **commemorate** the fallen of previous conflicts. He knew that even a **fractional number** of casualties would be tragic. He was trying to find a way to **decorate with** a peace symbol on the walls to calm down the tension. He knew that Grugg could be **hot-blooded**, and prone to making a **blunder**.

Young Elara, known for her **persuasive** arguments, attempted to speak with the warlord, but his **contempt** and **irritate** her with his unpredictable attitude. The warlord, displaying a **concentrated** rage, attempted to **threaten** her.

During his preparation for the battle, Grugg's assistant, a young man trained in **terrestrial** navigation, seemed particularly nervous. Grugg was determined to **expulsion** from the city of all non-believers. His assistant was supposed to be a **courier**, sent to deliver messages to other mercenary groups. But his **erratic** actions and the nervous glances **Aggravate 2** Grugg.

Meanwhile, the town's blacksmith, Master Borin, was hard at work. He had to **fasten** the new shields and armors for the defense, and he needed to use the **bitumen** to patch up some holes from the previous battles. He saw the **cricket** matches as **tedious** while preparing for the conflict.

Adding to the tension, reports surfaced of a local noble attempting to **neuter** Grugg's power through secret dealings, although the details remained murky. Their ties were rooted in the ancient principle of **consanguinity**, and their conflict served to *distend* the tension further.

The conflict, it seemed, was inevitable. The town braced itself, praying for a miracle and hoping for the **grasp** of control, and against the worst that was coming **by** Grugg.
