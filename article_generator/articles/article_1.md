The **crumble** of societal norms, the **casualty** of unchecked ambition, these are the things that often set the stage. The grand **auction** of the old estate was just the beginning. I felt the tug of an **awful** feeling, watching the **monotonous** parade of bidders. No one seemed to fully **absorb** the history clinging to the walls. One felt **entitled** to their desired item.

My companion, a history **docent** with a penchant for the theatrical, was **passionate about** preserving the past. He spoke of the rise and fall of empires, of the relentless march of **A|the|ism**, of the **peculiar** ways societies organize themselves. He was incredibly **eloquent**, able to draw on a vast vocabulary. The **coverage** of the **auction** in the local paper was rather **careless**, missing vital details about the provenance of certain items.

I had to steel myself. I had **suffered from one-sided love** for some time, and the **disagreement** I had with my heart, along with my past feelings. I used to **adore** him. Now all I felt was a **rival** feeling towards my own emotions.

The **exchange rate** wasn't a concern, though the prices were high, especially for the **crumbs** of historical significance offered. We found ourselves at the **summit** of the building where the **auction** was held. The top **compartment** was the *attic*. A **bungalow**, a structure I felt was **improbable** to be on such a structure. The **attire** of many of the attendees was surprisingly **chic**, an incongruous blend with the dusty antiques.

We passed the **pre|ci|pi|ce** on the way. **In succession**, the **numerous** items were displayed. It was a **concerted** effort to catalog them all, a task that would require a **commission** of dedicated people. I looked to get one that I can **fling** out of here, the task felt almost **inhuman**.

The constant chatter and the lack of **caution** from those around, the **cue** for the next bid, created a sense of almost giddy anticipation. You could only **typically** assume it was another purchase. I realized my **courage** was limited, I couldn't **conquer** the feeling of dread. Seeing him gave me a feeling that this event would **hinder** my chances of overcoming the situation I am dealing with. There were many, a **server** of people coming and going.

I had to be a smart buyer, to not **spoil** my own feelings, to not allow the **rival** to win. I needed to think **intellectual**, to not let emotion cloud my judgment. There was a **collocation** of negative feelings. I had to **execute** my plans, to **certify** that I didn't let emotions take over. 

We would return in the night and **reclamation** of some items would take place. He would **heave** a sigh whenever I was around. The impending **eclipse** of our situation was clear. His actions are proof of the **peculiar** nature he showed. This was far from the world's greatest achievement.
