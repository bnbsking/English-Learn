## The Old Cabin on the Cliff

The **dilapidated** **cabin** stood precariously on the edge of the **cliff**, overlooking the vast and unforgiving ocean. I found myself there, utterly **by myself**, seeking solace from the world. The silence, broken only by the crash of waves, was a welcome contrast to the **agitation** and noise that usually **inundate** my life.

I was **late** in arriving, having been **distract**ed by work. The **receptionist** at the clinic had been her usual **polite** self, but even her cheerful demeanor couldn't **fade away** the stress. I had recently received an **assessment** detailing my poor work performance and was feeling the pressure to improve. My boss, known for his **blatant** disregard for his **subordinate**s, especially if you were female, and who had a strong tendency for **male chauvinism** which **spark**ed **new problems**.

The old house, a testament to a past era, had a **grave** air about it. It was the scene of many previous dramas; it seemed to **creep** into my mind. I felt a sense of foreboding, perhaps **suggest**ing my recent issues, or maybe it was my **cynical** outlook on life. The memories of my youth, the simple **bounty** of childhood, now seemed like a distant dream, **consign**ed **to** the past.

I had to **bring about** some changes in my life. I was looking for a quiet place. I had a **berth** on the ocean, which I had acquired through my hard work. A certain degree of **autonomy** had given me a sense of freedom. The house's **collar**, a worn wooden door, seemed to **constrain** me from taking action. 

The **horror movie** I had watched a few days prior had **fascinate**d me. The plot was about a family who found a hidden **tomb** and, in an attempt to **blend** with it, discovered the family's true history. The themes of **deceit** and the need to find your true place in life really resonated with me. I had even started visiting the **barber (shop)** **regularly** and it had become a ritual. I was **allergic** to some of the ingredients they use in the shop, though.

I needed to **dedicate** myself **to** a new **curriculum**, a new direction. I needed to **evaluate** my life. My own work and the expectations of my friends and family had **compel**led me to make a change. My **thoughtful** decision was to seek professional help, to confront the things I was not **capable of** addressing alone. Maybe the **cruel** world could learn to be more kind. I wanted to learn to escape the **dictatorship** that society had become. The old house would be a place of healing, but my **domicile** was elsewhere, and my work would not **captivate** me. I wanted to be **dutiful**, but my efforts had brought me here. The **microvessels** of my brain screamed. Finally, I made a **league** of my own, and I would eventually start to live my life again.
