## A Day of Mixed Fortunes

The old train, its **compartment** smelling of dust and forgotten dreams, lumbered along the tracks. Inside, a **considerable** amount of tension hung in the air. I, a young aspiring writer, found myself sitting across from a man who looked like he could **concoct** a conspiracy out of thin air. He eyed me with a gaze that made me want to **hide**. I **attribute** this feeling to the fact that he was wearing a somewhat **horrendous** outfit – a mismatched **attire** that was far from **stylish**.

My thoughts, I must admit, often **confuse** themselves. I tried to **ponder** on what I could write for my next piece, but it was difficult. The world, or at least the world in this **context**, seemed to present a constant **drawback** – the looming **scarcity** of inspiration. Then I remembered a **tasteless** joke and it made me want to **drool over** the days of my youth when all that mattered was to **curl up** and read a book.

The old man began to speak. He warned me to **keep sth in bay** for any criminals, those who might be **indicted for** **pirated** goods, and especially those who might seek to **defile** my manuscript. He went on to say that the library **council** had become a platform to **conspire** and now would **delegate to** the younger generation. I wasn't sure what the library has to do with it, I just wanted to **obtain** some inspiration.

He then **attribute**d the **holocaust** to the **antagonism** of certain groups and began to talk about his theories of a secret society. His words were **tasteless** and his theories **deliberate**. It was hard to believe he was even human. He seemed to have a plan to **carry out sth**, although what that was, I couldn't be **certain**. 

Suddenly, he **extend an olive branch** and offered me an **assorted** snack. It tasted **tasteless**. I realized that it was not worth it for me to get **carry away**. After the snack, the man began to **concentrate** on the scenery outside.

The countryside, I **regard as** beautiful. It seemed to **be composed of** a **brilliant** mix of colours. I wanted to **obtain** a glimpse of the world that was **affordable** and would **entitle** me to a life where I could **eliminate** the anxiety.
I, in turn, **deduct** the man's theory and decided to leave. I also **consider** that being **hospitable** is a very important thing to do.

I hope one day I'll become **a master of** the pen. I'd write stories and essays. I hope the **ox** could provide strength. I'd like to be strong and have a **docile** character. Also, I hope there would be no **acne**. Perhaps I could get out of this train and **break away** from this chaos, or maybe **obtain** the life I **consider**. I might need to find an escape that won't **dampen** my spirit.

This trip reminded me of the importance of being a **rational number** and avoiding being **venomous**.
