## A Day of Mixed Fortunes

The day began with **excellent** news. I was finally **entitled to** the promotion I'd been working towards, a reward for my **concerted** efforts. I was **sure** this would be a turning point. After receiving this uplifting **advice**, I decided to **cancel** my plans to visit my cousin's **bungalow** and celebrate instead.

I needed to find a new suit for my first day in the new role, so I decided to **browse** through the **catalogue** of a local tailor. I noticed a **diagonal** pattern I liked but didn’t have much time to think about it. I made a note to **follow** up later.

My morning took a turn when I **missed the stop** on the bus and had to walk back. Annoyed, I started walking and saw a building that looked ready to **submerge** completely. In the distance, I could see the city's skyline and remembered I needed to **cause** a meeting between several companies. The **competition** between them was fierce, but I knew a **coalition** might be necessary.

Later, while on a **balcony**, I observed a game of baseball. Watching the **pitch** of a baseball reminded me of the many challenges in my career. I've had to **fight against** negativity, even if it seemed like I had to **crack down on** someone at times. I was very **qualified to** resolve these issues, but some felt they could **give me the runaround**.

I got to work, eager to start. However, I was held up when a friend wanted to borrow some money. He turned out to be a **deceiver**, leading me to believe his intentions. The argument made me feel **inarticulate** and I failed to convince him.

After my friend left, I started to **decorate with** old books. Then I remembered my cousin needed **advice** on how to **absorb** the **bitumen** for his driveway.

The afternoon saw me trying to organize a company function. It was an **absorbing** task, and I felt the **atom** of a solution coming together to form a plan. There were so many things to **execute**, and I felt a bit like a **chef** in a busy kitchen.

I looked up the local **archeology** museums in the **directory**. My research was delayed when I had to **discharge** a member of staff and heard that the new manager was a **Catholic**. It was hard to **catch on** to his ideas. This made me worry that the new **commission** would **result in** some problems.

The evening **concert** was going to be a great experience. I couldn’t **soak** in the information fast enough. I knew the concert was going to be **promising**, and I was right. The sound coming from the **gun tube** section was **colossal**. It was an evening to remember! I thought this might be the beginning of a beautiful plan.

I felt a bit **batter**ed by the day's events, but I knew that my future was bright. I even started to **blink** at the issues I had, seeing the small things of the day. I also had the chance to **reside in** another country on a long trip. I knew the future was going to be great if I could just **concede** that some issues are beyond my control. I also knew that the future would **freeze out** any of the bad events of the day. The **longitude** of problems would not affect the future.
