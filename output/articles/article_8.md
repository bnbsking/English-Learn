## The Shadow of the Old **Graveyard**

The old **graveyard**, shrouded in mist, always held an **ominous** presence in the town. **All along**, the townsfolk whispered stories of a **criminal** who sought refuge within its decaying walls. Their **allegiance** to the law was tested by the fear that the fugitive might **represent** a **detrimental consequence** for anyone who crossed his path.

The situation was becoming **acute**. The sheriff, a man known for his **fortitude**, vowed to bring the **criminal** to justice. He would not let the events create a **chasm** of lawlessness. He knew the risks. Facing such a dangerous suspect could lead to **confrontation** and the use of **bullets**. Yet, the sheriff **aspired to** uphold the law and would never be **disconcerted**. He was **scrupulous** in his duties.

He gathered his deputies for a **brisk** meeting. "We need to find a **clue**," he said. "This fugitive is proving difficult to catch. He has proven to be a clever man. He must be made to **prove** he is not above the law."

The sheriff sent a **docent** to inspect the area and look for a **clue**. The **docent** would look for anything. The **docent** may even **advise** the sheriff. There was a **billboard** offering a reward, hoping to **redeem** the situation.

The town was in turmoil. The **disadvantages** of the situation were clear. The **enforcement** of the law was necessary. Many wanted the criminal to **be acquitted of** the charges.
The sheriff knew that to take any action on the property would **obligate** the law.

He considered his actions. He didn't want to **discharge** his duties without **considerate** thought. He knew a hasty decision could be **counterproductive**.

The sheriff decided to **vie with** the **criminal** by finding him first. He had to **drive in an erratic course** through the **deserted** streets as night fell. He needed to **cloak** his movements in secrecy. He decided he would **dump** his previous plans. 

The sheriff was also concerned about the **cumbersome** procedure involved. The case required a comprehensive **appraisal**. He needed a solution that would **cement** the safety of his people, not make it worse.

The sheriff's **final** strategy involved several steps. His plan was to take them back to the **tournament**, but he knew that going to the **graveyard** was **insipid**. He did not want to be the one that would **put sb to shame**. He was **obligated** to find the **criminal**.
He had a **huge** problem and only a few resources. He considered the **cardinal** rule: that the law would always be upheld. He then realized the **counterpart** to his problem, which was to **be accommodated in** prison. This was not just a **fantasy**, but a real possibility.
He decided that if they caught the criminal, he would be ready to face his **detrimental consequence**.
