## A Day of Unexpected Turns

The **beginner** driver, barely able to reach the **traffic sign**, was already feeling **at the end of one’s rope/tether** after a series of unfortunate events. It all **give rise to** after he had an **accident** that day. The **infant** in the back seat began to cry, a sound that seemed to **overshadow** all other noises. Despite the chaos, he knew his **duty** was to remain **discreet**, but the situation was escalating.

He had been late picking up his **baby** from the **Dairy**, a place he **often** frequented. He considered himself **superior** to other drivers, but today, he made a mistake: He was **sometimes** overly **bold**, and that day it nearly cost him dearly. He **hurl** out of the vehicle in a **panic** looking for help. 

The **plaintiff** of the vehicle, a rather **bald** man, emerged from his car. He seemed **critical** of the driver's actions. The driver attempted to find a solution by **bail(ing) sb out of jail**. However, the police, sensing the **risky** nature of the situation, refused. 

As he waited, he noticed **various** things. A fallen **cork** had been thrown onto the street. He also felt **blunt** due to the stress and could not find any solution. A **vein** on his forehead throbbed.  The man was worried, and the current situation **enriched** the driver.

The **corpse** in the car had just **devour** the food. He looked for anything that could **comfort** him, but failed. He knew he needed to **fulfill** the tasks given by his **commission to** the law enforcement. **Via** the phone, a **cannon** was heard outside.

The driver's **cognitive function** was impaired by the stress. He had a **campaign** that day, and had to **compete with** his **opponent**. Suddenly, rain began to **drench** the scene.

He felt **vulgar**, and could feel the pain of **a succession of scandals** he's experienced.  He attempted to **shun** the media attention, hoping it would remain **invisible**.  His only desire was to **commemorate** the day with something **extraordinary** and **indispensable**, but he was **often** failing at doing so.  He hoped the day's events wouldn’t be the **accident** he was struggling to **fulfill** his **property**, and that the **clamp** on the car could somehow be released, and that the situation would **bloom**.
