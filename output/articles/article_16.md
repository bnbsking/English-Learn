## A Dreary Election and a Catalog of Disaster

The **electorate** in the small town of Oakhaven was in a state of **dismay**. The recent election was proving to be a **catalog of disaster**, with accusations of corruption and voter fraud swirling around the candidates. The whole situation was **horrible**. They all felt a sense of **dread** as the results continued to **separate** the community.

The incumbent, a **rookie** politician with **sloppy** policies, had attempted to **evade** tough questions throughout the campaign. His campaign was **outdated** and his ideas **indiscreet**. **Conversely**, his opponent, a seasoned **elector**, was accused of having **forged** documents. Neither candidate inspired much confidence.

One could hardly imagine what would happen next, for this was the most **dreary** season Oakhaven had ever seen. **On the other hand**, there were many things to be expected for the **house of representatives**, and the **form of state** should be taken seriously.

The town's old **mortuary**, usually quiet, was now eerily busy with preparations for the election, as the **lightning** of political upheaval had struck hard, leaving people fearful of the **calamity** that might follow. Residents had to **make up their mind** quickly. It felt as though the whole town was living a **compulsory subject**.

I went to the **cellar** to find my **belongings**. The **carpenter** had done a good job but the **pitch** was awful.

I saw **an ink blot** and my heart sank. My friend was **be stuck in the friendzone with** a girl and was feeling bad. It seemed he has **one’s foot in the grave**, always **persevering with** the girl.

The **ballot** was a source of both hope and anxiety. Citizens, after a **perfunctory** glance at their choices, cast their votes. The air was thick with **dread** and frustration. After the **climax**, the outcome was anyone’s guess. I looked towards the **crevice**, it was **contiguous with/to** the outside. My friend would **address** his feelings to the girl, he needed the **bravery**.

The election, while fraught with difficulties, offered a **wide range/realm of** challenges. I began to **assimilate** the concept, I hope he would not be **be stuck in the friendzone with** her anymore. But, on the **concrete** level, the election's conclusion was uncertain.

I decided to call the friend and **condole with** his situation. I also realized that the whole thing was **contrive**. I found the **loophole** in the situation and tried to help him **reclaim** his dignity. Although he was no longer **enthusiastic about** the girl, and although he was always **bump**ing into the **sharp** and **almond**-like thoughts, he will not make the mistake.
