## The King's Dilemma

The **usual** tranquility of the kingdom was shattered. **The rules dictate that** the new king, a man known for his **intelligent** mind and **intellectual** prowess, must navigate a treacherous path. His reign began with a **massive** crisis, the nature of which would test his resolve.

First, the kingdom faced a **menace** from a neighboring **enemy**. The enemy, emboldened by its military strength, **threaten** to **destroy** the borders. The King, advised by his **counsel**, considered his options. He could **delay** a military response, hoping for a peaceful solution. He could form an **alliance** with other kingdoms, hoping to **restrain** the aggressor.

The King, however, also faced internal strife. A **crook**, known for his **pompous** demeanor, attempted to **bribe** members of the court for his own gain. He wanted to **crack** the King's authority. The King, **zealous** in his duty, refused to **comply with** such corruption. He wanted to **wipe out** these bad influences.

Then came a **sentimental** matter that caused him **sorrowful**. The King discovered that the water supply had been **poison** and many citizens became ill. It was feared that the crops had also been **poison**, making the food **inedible**. The king needed to **ascertain** the source of the contamination.

The King faced these challenges **in succession**. He needed to find a solution for each of them. There was the issue of a **dispute** over land rights. The kingdom's **franchise store** was going bankrupt. He needed to be **determinate**. The King was also **accused of** being **reckless** with his decisions. He felt like his life could **sink**.

He felt **dissoluted** and weary. He felt he would **buckle** under the strain. But he remembered a time when he was young, before he had become the King. He remembered the beautiful **porcelain** figurine he had had, a symbol of peace and hope. Remembering it was a **bond** with his past. His **facial features** grew **unusual** as he recalled his lover, who had just **dumped** him. He wanted to **drown**. 

He also thought of the importance of **chronological** order. He knew he would **excel in** using the proper order in his speech. He was determined not to **exaggerate** his words. If he could, he would never **annihilate** anyone. He would never **obliterate** the memories he had. He did not wish to **nominate** anyone to go against the rules. He knew his responsibility to **compensate** and make things right. The King, though tempted to give in, would not **threaten** anyone. He would **restrain** his emotions.
