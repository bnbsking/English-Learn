# A Desolate Colony's Trials and Triumphs

The old **colony**, once bustling with life, now felt utterly **desolate**. The reasons were many, a **mixture** of bad decisions and **dreadful** circumstances. Things weren't **normal**; a series of events had thrown everything into disarray.

It all began with a **crime of a teenager**, a seemingly small act that would **inflame** tensions within the various **faction**s of the community. These groups often **confront**ed each other, disagreements fueled by perceived **discrepancy** in resource allocation.  The situation was only **exacerbate**d by the introduction of a **regressive tax**, which disproportionately affected the poor. This was a far cry from what was once considered **commonplace**.

The colonial **apparatus**, once a symbol of authority, began to crumble. Officials, **behind time** with their duties, struggled to maintain order. The community was unable to address the root cause of the challenges and were constantly in **agony** from poor management.

The **etiquette** of the colony, once carefully observed, was now disregarded by some, who were nothing but a **blabbermouth** and too **mouthy**. Attempts to **tame** the unruly elements proved challenging. The council found it hard to **empower** the right people to deal with the situation.

The colony faced a budget **discrepancy**. To manage this and to **curtail expense**, the officials **decree**d measures, like limiting the **allowance** for families. It was a **crude** solution and had little effect.

Many felt **humiliate**d by the situation, they also felt **underway** to **submerge** in the mess. Some found comfort by being **cuddly** with their family, while others became **ardent** supporters of the rebels who wanted to **smash** the old system. The rebels' **colloquial** language and simple ideas found a wider audience.

The administration created a small **booklet** to explain the situation. The contents, though, didn't always **indicate** their future intentions. They tried to **ornament with** pretty pictures and easy wording.

In the long term, the authorities thought they could use tools to **chisel** their way to the solution.  They needed to figure out how to make people **absorb** the ideas in the booklet. 

The situation was made **definitely** worse as some families needed to be **evict**ed. They felt the world around them was in **agony**. However, some citizens worked **diligently** to **accomplish** the task. They found ways to be **productive** and use their skills to help the community.

One thing they all **conclude**d was that they had to find a new way forward. The council should **certify** the plans. But they were scared to **go overboard** with their optimism. They hoped to find a more **compact** way to face the issues and, eventually, solve them.
