## The Shadow of the Past: A Chronological Account

The **chronic** pain in my knee, a result of a childhood **accident**, **aggravates** my mood **occasionally**. I find myself **by myself** more often these days, struggling to **fill** the void left by the past. The memories, however, are etched in my mind. I'll try to **chronicle** them here.

It all began, I suppose, with the **terrible** news of my grandfather's death. He was a man who always sought **authentic** experiences and had been a **voter** in a time before the **dictatorship** took hold. I **witnessed** firsthand the erosion of freedom. We couldn't **authorize** any kind of public mourning without fear of retribution.

The official cause of death was listed as a heart attack, but there were whispers. Some **alluded to** the fact that he was investigating the **drug abuse** rampant in the **autonomous region** and that the government was involved. My grandfatherâ€™s body was sent for **cremation** , and the ashes were placed in a simple **cremation urn**. This was a way to hide the body from **grave robbing**.

The events following his death were truly **terrible**. I, his only grandson, was suspected of being a member of a secret **union** and eventually **charged with** plotting to **incite** a **riot**. I, however, did not **conform to** the expectations of the government and decided to **abdicate** from the situation. 

I remember the **bruise** I got when I was arrested. The pain was **acute**, a sharp sting against the weight of the accusation. The guards accused me of **shoplifting** a local grocery store. Luckily, I was eventually released.

The whole event caused immense psychological pressure and it was not surprising that I developed **acne** and started using painkillers. I was too scared to speak out; and, in a way, I **deceived** myself into believing it was not that **terrible**, even though, I could see no real **causal relationship** between my actions and the accusations I was facing.

The situation became a nightmare. One of the **casualties** of the regime, my uncle, was taken out in a protest. It was not unusual to see such things. I, therefore, made a decision to leave. I could not **obey** the officials, and I feared being arrested again. It was **incredible**, but the regime had all but erased the **indigenous** culture.

Before leaving, I wanted to retrieve some belongings from my house. However, when I went to my house, I found it **dissoluted**. It was a **fantastic** sight.

Then, I went to see my friend. I told him about the incident. He asked me: "**Ain't** you scared? You can be **mugged** or even worse."

The memories are like fragments of glass, sharp and painful, and they never leave you. I had to **exhume** the truth about what had happened to my grandfather before going. And, sometimes, I still consider the **toll** these events took on me. Even though the details might be missing or incorrect, I would like to have the **chronological** order of these events.
